## Dependencies
- [MATLAB cbrewer](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/34087-cbrewer-colorbrewer-schemes-for-matlab)
- [MATLAB circular statistics toolbox](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/10676-circular-statistics-toolbox-directional-statistics)
- We have already included them here (`cbrewer`) and (`CircStat`), but would like to explicitly acknowledge the use of these two packages.

## Code Usage
- **Set the current directory of MATLAB to the root directory of this project.** See special instructions below for reproducing Figure S5 and S6.  
- Each folder contains one or more MATLAB script(s) (and other helper functions) that produce the corresponding figure in the paper, as indicated by its name.
- Run the "addpath" section first with the "Run Section" button in MATLAB (to include libraries and other helper functions), and then run the entire script.
- For Figure S5 and S6, we reformatted the data file so it contains the reaction time data. 
- To run those analysis, **set MATLAB's current directory to `./Figure_S5_S6`.** Run `figS5_rt.m` for the reaction time analysis, and `figS6_fb.m` for the sliding window analysis.
